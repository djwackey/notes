# Professional Cloud Architect

1. Your company's test suite is a custom C++ application that runs tests throughout each day on Linux virtual machines. The full test suite takes several hours to complete, running on a limited number of on-premises servers reserved for testing. Your company wants to move the testing infrastructure to the cloud, to reduce the amount of time it takes to fully test a change to the system, while changing the tests as little as possible. Which cloud infrastructure should you recommend?

  - A. Google Compute Engine unmanaged instance groups and Network Load Balancer
  - B. Google Compute Engine managed instance groups with auto-scaling
  - C. Google Cloud Dataproc to run Apache Hadoop jobs to process each test
  - D. Google App Engine with Google StackDriver for logging
